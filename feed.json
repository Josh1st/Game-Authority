I really enjoyed the team deathmatch mode as it enables you to practice without having to load up a whole BR game.</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>I feel like the controls are reasonably polished, a bit more aim assist would be nice. overall it’s a really good game and it seems that the developers are well invested in the game.</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>BUT! I think I noticed other players that I suspect to have been using mouse and keyboard which really sucks, as it’s very hard to compete against. I hope they will be able to further improve their detection systems to make the game better for its intended audience.</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>The game does not seem to have any pay to win elements, just like its big brother. It’s pretty much an ultra-low graphics version of pubg, so a lot of your knowledge from pubg is easily transferable.</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:heading --></p>\n<h2>Cyber Hunter</h2>\n<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>Link: <a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.netease.lztgglobal&amp;hl=en\">https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.netease.lztgglobal&amp;hl=en</a></p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>Cyber Hunter is pretty much a must download. The graphics are really great and the controls are really smooth, I did experience a bit of intermittent lag but as I said I had the same problem in all of the games, Also the auto-firing is way off sometimes which can prematurely alert your opponent. This games overall polish trumps all the games on this list, it feels like everything is where it should be when considering the map, it was not too small and was not too big, there were enough vehicles that you won’t feel like you are in a running simulator, but if you did make your way on foot you would not get too bored.</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>This game also features climbing and gliding mechanics which I think are really great. The only thing I would ask for is higher structures for better vantage points.</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:heading --></p>\n<h2>Garena Free Fire</h2>\n<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>Link: <a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.dts.freefireth&amp;hl=en\">https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.dts.freefireth&amp;hl=en</a></p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>Garena Free Fire graphics are not that great and the consoles could be improved but that’s where the complaints end. Its a really solid game. Where I think it shines is its aim assists, you may not agree with me but I wholeheartedly welcome it, playing on mobile is hard enough, adding the complexity of touch aiming makes things a lot harder so I welcome this games aiming mechanics.</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:heading --></p>\n<h2>Call Of Duty Mobile</h2>\n<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>Link: <a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.activision.callofduty.shooter&amp;hl=en\">https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.activision.callofduty.shooter&amp;hl=en</a></p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>Call of duty mobile is a great game. it has multiple game modes to choose from and has ranked (unloked at level 10) and unranked modes so you can either be againts only real players or potentially have bots mixed in. Its really up to you, if you just want to pass the time and have fun the try unranked. but if you are bit more serious then try ranked.</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>One big concern I have with this game is that it seems mobile players are beeing lumped in with pc players using an emulator which isnt very fare at all. However, if you are a reasonable player you can still be good even through you are on mobile, just dont say i didnt warn you if you get REKT by pc players. In PUBG Mobile, all emulator players (pc players) will play against each other. Now the same developers who made PUBG Mobile have made COD Mobile, but it seems that COD Mobile players do not get the same treatmeant as PUBG Mobile players.</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>I have fotage of both mobile gameplay and pc gameplay labled in the video.</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:heading --></p>\n<h2>Creative Destruction</h2>\n<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>Link: <a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.titan.cd.gb&amp;hl=en\">https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.titan.cd.gb&amp;hl=en</a></p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>I’m Going to preface my review of Creative Destruction with this, I do not like Fortnite or builder games like it. That being said it’s still quite a good game. If you like Fortnite then this is the game for you. Some things I really don’t like that it inherits from its clone brother is the lack of ADS. Not having ADS on such a tiny screen makes spotting distant opponents pretty difficult. another problem I faced was intermittent lag for like 2 seconds at a time. All the games I played had intermittent lag, Creative Destruction was ever so slightly worse. Other than that it was perfectly playable and actually quite enjoyable.</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:heading --></p>\n<h2>Rules Of Survival</h2>\n<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>Link: <a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.netease.chiji&amp;hl=en\">https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.netease.chiji&amp;hl=en</a></p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>Rules of Survival seems to have lost its mojo. I used to think it was great but this time around I think it falls a bit short. but is it a throwaway? Definitely not. It’s still a good game with pretty good controls and above-average graphics. But this time around it just didn’t gel with me as much as original PUBG.</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:heading --></p>\n<h2>Knives Out</h2>\n<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>Link: <a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.netease.ko&amp;hl=en\">https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.netease.ko&amp;hl=en</a></p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>Knives Out is fairly similar to Rules Of Survival but has slightly toned down graphics. On the plus side, it does stick closer to being a more serious <strong>battle royal game on android. </strong>Its probably the closest thing to PUBG mobile second to Garena Free Fire. But it has its flaws, most notably, view distance is too short and maps are way too big. Other than that its still a pretty good game.</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>",

Otherwise getting all the mods for your gun and following the story was a lot of fun.</p>\n<p>WARNING: bellow video contains swearing.</p>\n<p>https://youtu.be/Lu6kQtxQbqU</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Mirror's Edge Catalyst</h3>\n<p>This game looks soo damn cool and is a pretty good game from what I have played so far (haven't finished it yet). It's not the best game on this list but it seems like a challenging game that has depth and a reasonable story.</p>\n<p>https://youtu.be/214T767T_5s</p>\n",

I understand that everyone has different tastes so when going through this list don't pay too much attention to the games rank, just pick a game that you think is good.</p>\n<p>Now that that is established let's see what are the Best Free Fps Shooter Games for PC.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Counter-Strike: Global Offensive</h2>\n<p>Counter-Strike: Global Offensive is the Quintessential FPS shooter of our modern gaming era. Its the game is very simple to understand but requires a lot of skill. If you are looking for the purest form of an fps game this is it (for our modern era).</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Destiny 2</h2>\n<p>Destiny 2 released the base version of there game for Free, which is huge. Some people did not like Destiny 2 at launch but now that its free is really tough not to recommend. It features a relatively good multiplayer and when you get bored of that the base game is where it's at. It's a lot of fun I highly recommend this game.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Warface</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6vHOR8lzTg\">LET ME SEE YOUR WARFACE!</a> Warface has been around for a while but is still very good. The game mechanics and controls feel very solid, I just wish the movement speed was faster, otherwise good TTK and seems to be quite good in the guns and mods department.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Quake Champions</h2>\n<p>Quake Champions is certainly a fun, intense game. It requires a fair amount of skill and has a learning curve. I haven't learned the game fully yet but I can say that I see why this game has stayed alive for so long.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Ironsight</h2>\n<p>Ironsight is a solid game that you are sure to enjoy, though it lacks some polish, It's still in beta so hopefully they can make the game feel more polished. however, the games polish is a pretty minor complaint and the game is worth checking out.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>The Cycle</h2>\n<p>The Cycle is sort of a battle royal PvP PvE kind of game, I have some complaints.</p>\n<p>1. There is something weird going on with the mouse sensitivity or something. whenever I spin up a new game I set up my mouse sensitivity so that when moving my mouse 260mm to the left the camera rotates 180 degrees and for some odd reason, when repeating a mouse movement for a given distance the camera rotates at vastly different degrees. For example, one moment I move my mouse by 260mm and the camera will rotate by 220 degrees, but then ill repeat the exact same test and my camera will rotate by 180 degrees so the current sensitivity and input implementation are not that great and could use some work.</p>\n<p>2. The Time To Kill is a bit long to takedown players. I think it could do with 3-4 respawns but I much quicker TTK.</p>\n<p>3. I'm nitpicking but the UI could use some improvements. The high-quality game does not match up too well with the UI, again I'm just nitpicking, it's not a big deal at all.</p>\n<p>Other than that its a fun and unique game that breaks the mould of the traditional battle royal and I recommend checking it out every once in awhile until its full release.</p>\n<p>UPDATE: They seem to have made adjustments to the TTK and it plays a lot better now.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Ring Of Elysium</h2>\n<p>Ring Of Elysium is a unique take on the battle royal genre but does not stray too far away from the likes of PUBG. I was very surprised at this games level of polish its a real contender in the battle royal scene. It probably deserves a better place on this list but like most battle royales it's very unforgiving when you die in-game and it's nice to play something that is not a battle royale every once in a while.</p>\n",

I think I noticed other players that I suspect to have been using mouse and keyboard which really sucks, as it’s very hard to compete against. I hope they will be able to further improve their detection systems to make the game better for its intended audience.</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>The game does not seem to have any pay to win elements, just like its big brother. It’s pretty much an ultra-low graphics version of pubg, so a lot of your knowledge from pubg is easily transferable.</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p></p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p></p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:heading --></p>\n<h2>Cyber Hunter</h2>\n<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p></p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p></p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>Link:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.netease.lztgglobal&amp;hl=en\">https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.netease.lztgglobal&amp;hl=en</a></p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p></p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>Cyber Hunter is pretty much a must download. The graphics are really great and the controls are really smooth, I did experience a bit of intermittent lag but as I said I had the same problem in all of the games, Also the auto-firing is way off sometimes which can prematurely alert your opponent. This games overall polish trumps all the games on this list, it feels like everything is where it should be when considering the map, it was not too small and was not too big, there were enough vehicles that you won’t feel like you are in a running simulator, but if you did make your way on foot you would not get too bored.</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>This game also features climbing and gliding mechanics which I think are really great.

Its really up to you, if you just want to pass the time and have fun the try unranked. but if you are bit more serious then try ranked.</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>One big concern I have with this game is that it seems mobile players are beeing lumped in with pc players using an emulator which isnt very fare at all. However, if you are a reasonable player you can still be good even through you are on mobile, just dont say i didnt warn you if you get REKT by pc players. In PUBG Mobile, all emulator players (pc players) will play against each other. Now the same developers who made PUBG Mobile have made COD Mobile, but it seems that COD Mobile players do not get the same treatmeant as PUBG Mobile players.</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>I have fotage of both mobile gameplay and pc gameplay labled in the video.</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p></p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p></p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:heading --></p>\n<h2>Creative Destruction</h2>\n<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p></p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p></p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>Link:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.titan.cd.gb&amp;hl=en\">https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.titan.cd.gb&amp;hl=en</a></p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p></p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>I’m Going to preface my review of&nbsp;Creative Destruction with this, I do not like Fortnite or builder games like it. That being said it’s still quite a good game. If you like Fortnite then this is the game for you. Some things I really don’t like that it inherits from its clone brother is the lack of ADS. Not having ADS on such a tiny screen makes spotting distant opponents pretty difficult. another problem I faced was intermittent lag for like 2 seconds at a time. All the games I played had&nbsp;intermittent lag,&nbsp;Creative Destruction was ever so slightly worse. Other than that it was perfectly playable and actually quite enjoyable.</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p></p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p></p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:heading --></p>\n<h2>Rules Of Survival</h2>\n<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p></p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p></p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>Link:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.netease.chiji&amp;hl=en\">https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.netease.chiji&amp;hl=en</a></p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p></p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>Rules of Survival seems to have lost its mojo.

Record audio and video:</h3>\n<p>Now to explain why we needed to pass audio through the computer and out the speakers. It is so that we can record the audio coming from the android device on the computer secondly its is so that the recording app on your phone can pick up the audio coming from the speakers (which comes from the android device that you are recording on). We do this so that when we join the audio recorded on the computer to the video recorded on the phone, we can tell our editing software to sync the audio to the video. Otherwise, it's extremely difficult to sync the audio to the video without some reference as to which sound byte goes where. You don't need to understand right now, just trust me. let's continue.</p>\n<p>Now you are receiving audio from your android phone to your computer. Now you need to be able to record the audio on your pc. You can do this through whichever software you like but a good free software to use is Audacity. Download here: <a href=\"https://www.audacityteam.org/download/\">https://www.audacityteam.org/download/</a></p>\n<p>Install it and open it and select the correct audio source, either \"Microphone\" or \"Line In\".</p>\n<p>On your android device get your recoding app open and ready to record.</p>\n<p>On your computer click the red record button to start capturing audio from your android device.</p>\n<figure class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-216674\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://josh1st.github.io/Game-Authority/media/posts/46/Capture6_LI.jpg\" sizes=\"(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px\" srcset=\"https://josh1st.github.io/Game-Authority/media/posts/46/responsive/Capture6_LI-xs.jpg 300w ,https://josh1st.github.io/Game-Authority/media/posts/46/responsive/Capture6_LI-sm.jpg 480w ,https://josh1st.github.io/Game-Authority/media/posts/46/responsive/Capture6_LI-md.jpg 768w ,https://josh1st.github.io/Game-Authority/media/posts/46/responsive/Capture6_LI-lg.jpg 1024w ,https://josh1st.github.io/Game-Authority/media/posts/46/responsive/Capture6_LI-xl.jpg 1360w ,https://josh1st.github.io/Game-Authority/media/posts/46/responsive/Capture6_LI-2xl.jpg 1600w\"  alt=\"\" width=\"926\" height=\"704\" /></figure>\n<p>Now start recording the video on your android device. if you are using Google Play Games then click the red record button.</p>\n<figure class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-216663\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://josh1st.github.io/Game-Authority/media/posts/46/Screenshot_2020-01-22-14-26-58-208_com.miui_.home_LI.jpg\" sizes=\"(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px\" srcset=\"https://josh1st.github.io/Game-Authority/media/posts/46/responsive/Screenshot_2020-01-22-14-26-58-208_com.miui_.home_LI-xs.jpg 300w ,https://josh1st.github.io/Game-Authority/media/posts/46/responsive/Screenshot_2020-01-22-14-26-58-208_com.miui_.home_LI-sm.jpg 480w ,https://josh1st.github.io/Game-Authority/media/posts/46/responsive/Screenshot_2020-01-22-14-26-58-208_com.miui_.home_LI-md.jpg 768w ,https://josh1st.github.io/Game-Authority/media/posts/46/responsive/Screenshot_2020-01-22-14-26-58-208_com.miui_.home_LI-lg.jpg 1024w ,https://josh1st.github.io/Game-Authority/media/posts/46/responsive/Screenshot_2020-01-22-14-26-58-208_com.miui_.home_LI-xl.jpg 1360w ,https://josh1st.github.io/Game-Authority/media/posts/46/responsive/Screenshot_2020-01-22-14-26-58-208_com.miui_.home_LI-2xl.jpg 1600w\"  alt=\"\" width=\"428\" height=\"906\" /></figure>\n<p>when you are finished recording stop the video recording.</p>\n<figure class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-216665\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://josh1st.github.io/Game-Authority/media/posts/46/Screenshot_2020-01-22-14-27-19-168_com.miui_.home_LI.jpg\" sizes=\"(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px\" srcset=\"https://josh1st.github.io/Game-Authority/media/posts/46/responsive/Screenshot_2020-01-22-14-27-19-168_com.miui_.home_LI-xs.jpg 300w ,https://josh1st.github.io/Game-Authority/media/posts/46/responsive/Screenshot_2020-01-22-14-27-19-168_com.miui_.home_LI-sm.jpg 480w ,https://josh1st.github.io/Game-Authority/media/posts/46/responsive/Screenshot_2020-01-22-14-27-19-168_com.miui_.home_LI-md.jpg 768w ,https://josh1st.github.io/Game-Authority/media/posts/46/responsive/Screenshot_2020-01-22-14-27-19-168_com.miui_.home_LI-lg.jpg 1024w ,https://josh1st.github.io/Game-Authority/media/posts/46/responsive/Screenshot_2020-01-22-14-27-19-168_com.miui_.home_LI-xl.jpg 1360w ,https://josh1st.github.io/Game-Authority/media/posts/46/responsive/Screenshot_2020-01-22-14-27-19-168_com.miui_.home_LI-2xl.jpg 1600w\"  alt=\"\" width=\"428\" height=\"906\" /></figure>\n<p>Now on your computer stop the audio recording.</p>\n<figure class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-216677\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://josh1st.github.io/Game-Authority/media/posts/46/Capture7_LI.jpg\" sizes=\"(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px\" srcset=\"https://josh1st.github.io/Game-Authority/media/posts/46/responsive/Capture7_LI-xs.jpg 300w ,https://josh1st.github.io/Game-Authority/media/posts/46/responsive/Capture7_LI-sm.jpg 480w ,https://josh1st.github.io/Game-Authority/media/posts/46/responsive/Capture7_LI-md.jpg 768w ,https://josh1st.github.io/Game-Authority/media/posts/46/responsive/Capture7_LI-lg.jpg 1024w ,https://josh1st.github.io/Game-Authority/media/posts/46/responsive/Capture7_LI-xl.jpg 1360w ,https://josh1st.github.io/Game-Authority/media/posts/46/responsive/Capture7_LI-2xl.jpg 1600w\"  alt=\"\" width=\"925\" height=\"706\" /></figure>\n<p>Then on Audacity click File &gt; export &gt; Export as mp3, and choose a destination.</p>\n<p>Then connect your phone to your computer and copy the video you just recorded to your computer.</p>\n<h3></h3>\n<h3>Step 3. Sync your video to your audio</h3>\n<p>Cool, we now have our video and audio on our computer. We can now import our files into our video editing software. I'm not very familiar with video editing but I will be using premier pro but there are free alternatives that are very good:</p>\n<h4>Premiere Pro:</h4>\n<p>My video</p>\n<p>https://youtu.be/hDS3o_OxAdo</p>\n<p>A better video</p>\n<p>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OKiDPjj1Ms</p>\n<h4 class=\"title style-scope ytd-video-primary-info-renderer\">Davinci Resolve:</h4>\n<p>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3jvpC3Jhdo</p>\n<p>HitFilm Express (Manual 😪):</p>\n<p>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDA3SEgcmHo</p>\n\n<p>Now edit your video as you normally would. That's it for this method.</p>\n<h2></h2>\n<h2></h2>\n<h2>The Janky Way</h2>\n<p>If you don't have access to a computer you could follow the above method but ramp up the volume of what you are trying to record and let your microphone pick up the audio and call it a day. it will probably sound terrible though but it technically is an option.</p>\n<h2></h2>\n<h2></h2>\n<h2 class=\"AHFaub\">Vysor (paid app)</h2>\n<figure class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-216681\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://josh1st.github.io/Game-Authority/media/posts/46/unnamed.png\" sizes=\"(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px\" srcset=\"https://josh1st.github.io/Game-Authority/media/posts/46/responsive/unnamed-xs.png 300w ,https://josh1st.github.io/Game-Authority/media/posts/46/responsive/unnamed-sm.png 480w ,https://josh1st.github.io/Game-Authority/media/posts/46/responsive/unnamed-md.png 768w ,https://josh1st.github.io/Game-Authority/media/posts/46/responsive/unnamed-lg.png 1024w ,https://josh1st.github.io/Game-Authority/media/posts/46/responsive/unnamed-xl.png 1360w ,https://josh1st.github.io/Game-Authority/media/posts/46/responsive/unnamed-2xl.png 1600w\"  alt=\"\" width=\"180\" height=\"180\" /></figure>\n<p>If your device does not have a built-in screen recorder and you aren't a fan of the method to stitch audio to video then you could buy the Vysor app buy ClockworkMod. It allows you to share your android screen with your computer and enables you to record your android phone wirelessly.</p>\n<p>Link Here: <a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.koushikdutta.vysor&amp;hl=en_ZA\">https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.koushikdutta.vysor&amp;hl=en_ZA</a></p>\n<h2></h2>\n<h2></h2>\n<h2>The Emulator Method</h2>\n<p>One way to record your android screen is just don't do it. There are really great emulators out there that you can use on your computer and then record the gameplay on your pc of the emulator. Most emulators even include recording functionality that its a one-stop-shop.</p>\n<p><strong>Some emulators to consider:</strong></p>\n<p>Game Loop: <a href=\"https://gameloop.fun/\">https://gameloop.fun/</a></p>\n<p>Nox: <a href=\"https://www.bignox.com/\">https://www.bignox.com/</a></p>\n<p>Phoenix OS: <a href=\"http://www.phoenixos.com/en/download_x86\">http://www.phoenixos.com/en/download_x86</a></p>\n<p>Remix OS Player: <a href=\"https://remix-os-player.en.softonic.com/\">https://remix-os-player.en.softonic.com/</a></p>\n<p>The Cleanest method will be Virtualbox Plus Osboxes, but its a little more complicated.</p>\n<p>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JQc6VXuwlWk</p>\n",

However, it's still great value for money even with fewer games. My best guess is that Microsoft is trying to blur the lines between Xbox and PC in order to gain dominance over Sony, So we should expect fewer Xbox exclusives and more Microsoft platform (PC and Xbox) exclusives. Anyway, What's so special about the PC version?</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Lower Price.</li>\n<li>it gives you access to 100+ games</li>\n<li>New games added all the time</li>\n<li>Xbox Game Studios titles when they premiere</li>\n<li>Exclusive member discounts and deals</li>\n</ul>\n<p>View Games <a href=\"https://www.xbox.com/en-za/xbox-game-pass/games?xr=shellnav#\">Here</a></p>\n\n<h3>ULTIMATE:</h3>\n<p>Cost: R199 / m</p>\n<p>Xbox Game Pass Ultimate edition is simply the Console version plus the pc version AND includes Xbox Live Gold (which normally cost R159 / m). So it makes sense to get the ultimate edition if you were paying for Xbox Live Gold and want to get Xbox Game Pass as well. What's so special about the PC version?</p>\n<ul>\n<li>it gives you access to 228 games (Xbox one) and 100+ games on PC</li>\n<li>New games added all the time</li>\n<li>Xbox Game Studios titles when they premiere</li>\n<li>Exclusive member discounts and deals</li>\n<li>Includes Xbox Live Gold</li>\n</ul>\n<p>View Games <a href=\"https://www.xbox.com/en-za/xbox-game-pass/games?xr=shellnav#\">Here</a></p>\n\n<h2>So Is It Worth It?</h2>\n<p>I would say yes it is especially if you are on console. They are constantly adding more games and seem to be releasing some Microsoft games on Game Pass the same day as release. But not all games, for example, Quantum Break (released 2016) is a Microsoft exclusive on both Xbox and PC but it only included <span>Xbox Game Pass Ultimate 😒 <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZIpFytCSVc\">BRUH</a>, that's just silly to me.</span></p>\n<p><span>Also, a lot of the games probably won't appeal to you. so you best browse the catalogue before making a decision. That being said, maybe you should try some games you normally wouldn't, you may just like them 😃.</span></p>\n<p><span>It's not that expensive so you should just give it a shot and play something. Maybe try the </span>Halo: The Master Chief Collection or the new Gears of war. and if you don't like it you haven't wasted an arm and a leg. this is pretty obvious advice but I stand by it, If you have anything to add please comment bellow!</p>\n<p>[/et_pb_text][/et_pb_column][/et_pb_row][/et_pb_section][et_pb_section fb_built=\"1\" admin_label=\"Feature - Data\" _builder_version=\"3.17.6\" custom_padding=\"0|0|54px|0px|false|false\" global_module=\"216370\" saved_tabs=\"all\" locked=\"off\"][et_pb_row _builder_version=\"4.2\" width=\"100%\" max_width=\"none\" custom_padding=\"52px|0px|0|0px|false|false\"][et_pb_column type=\"4_4\" _builder_version=\"3.25\" custom_padding=\"|||\" custom_padding__hover=\"|||\"][et_pb_code _builder_version=\"4.2\" text_orientation=\"center\" module_alignment=\"center\"]\n<div class=\"alignleft\"><!-- [et_pb_line_break_holder] -->     <script type=\"text/javascript\"><!-- [et_pb_line_break_holder] -->       \tamzn_assoc_ad_type = \"banner\";<!-- [et_pb_line_break_holder] -->\tamzn_assoc_marketplace = \"amazon\";<!-- [et_pb_line_break_holder] -->\tamzn_assoc_region = \"US\";<!-- [et_pb_line_break_holder] -->\tamzn_assoc_placement = \"assoc_banner_placement_default\";<!-- [et_pb_line_break_holder] -->\tamzn_assoc_campaigns = \"videogames\";<!-- [et_pb_line_break_holder] -->\tamzn_assoc_banner_type = \"category\";<!-- [et_pb_line_break_holder] -->\tamzn_assoc_isresponsive = \"true\";<!-- [et_pb_line_break_holder] -->\tamzn_assoc_banner_id = \"1JXKSE03HFCDJM0S6X02\";<!-- [et_pb_line_break_holder] -->\tamzn_assoc_tracking_id = \"gameauthori06-20\";<!-- [et_pb_line_break_holder] -->\tamzn_assoc_linkid = \"dece9519e6fc86d74ccba7cfa9b5302d\";<!-- [et_pb_line_break_holder] -->     </script><!-- [et_pb_line_break_holder] -->     <script src=\"//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/q?ServiceVersion=20070822&Operation=GetScript&ID=OneJS&WS=1\"></script><!-- [et_pb_line_break_holder] -->    </div>\n<p>[/et_pb_code][/et_pb_column][/et_pb_row][et_pb_row _builder_version=\"3.25\" custom_padding=\"52px|0px|0|0px|false|false\"][et_pb_column type=\"4_4\" _builder_version=\"3.25\" custom_padding=\"|||\" custom_padding__hover=\"|||\"][et_pb_comments _builder_version=\"3.18.1\" custom_button=\"on\" button_text_size=\"14px\" button_text_color=\"#ffffff\" button_bg_color=\"#593aff\" button_border_width=\"0px\" button_letter_spacing=\"1.5px\" button_font=\"Muli|800|||||||\" custom_padding=\"85px||\" button_bg_color__hover=\"#783aff\" button_bg_color__hover_enabled=\"on\"][/et_pb_comments][/et_pb_column][/et_pb_row][/et_pb_section]</p>\n",

With my current csgo settings, however, I probably need to increase my sensitivity a bit because turning takes too many mouse lifts. So going too low is not a good idea either, you don't want to find yourself at the edge of your mouse pad.</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>I will increase CSGOs sensitivity to 2 giving me an effective dpi of 800.</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p></p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p></p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:heading {\"level\":4} --></p>\n<h4>Results</h4>\n<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>Round 1: 43</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>Round 2: 43</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>Round 3: 40</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>Average: 42</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>Increase: 0.8%</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p></p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p></p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} --></p>\n<h3>Aim Training</h3>\n<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p></p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p></p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>Ever notice how PRO GAMERS like Shroud seem to latch onto the enemy seemingly so easily? It has a lot to do with muscle memory. They have trained there mind subconsciously to know how far to move the mouse to get the cross hair on to the enemies noggin. Think about it, if you do something enough times it becomes second nature to you, like riding a bicycle, you don't think about balancing you just balance.</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>So in the next tests, I am going to try out different aim training programs and measure my improvement after each session. Now ideally you would train for much longer, but the point of this article is just to see what works and what doesn't.</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>In each aim training software, there are many training scenarios, we will just be focusing on the flick shoot type training.</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p></p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p></p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:heading {\"level\":4} --></p>\n<h4>Aim Lab</h4>\n<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p></p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p></p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://store.steampowered.com/app/714010/Aim_Lab/\">https://store.steampowered.com/app/714010/Aim_Lab/</a></p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>Here I used the SpiderShot with precision mode training program. I redid the program multiple times (about 4 times) until I felt comfortable with my results. Then I did one round of csgo bots then back to Aim Lab again I repeated the training program until I felt comfortable with the result. I did this for each round.</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>Round 1: 49</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>Round 2: 42</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>Round 1: 49</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>Average:&nbsp;46.666666666667</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>Increase:&nbsp;12% (from Baseline)</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>Increase: 11.11% (Previous test)</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p></p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p></p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:heading {\"level\":4} --></p>\n<h4>CS:GO training_aim_csgo2_dark</h4>\n<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p></p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p></p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>training_aim_csgo2_dark offers basic aim training similar to&nbsp;Aim Labs&nbsp;SpiderShot. So why&nbsp;training_aim_csgo2_dark?</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>Aim Labs is currently in very early access which means there are a few bugs, mainly mouse drift. I notice that my mouse keeps drifting back to the bottom of my mouse pad as I continue the training program, so it's not ideal for&nbsp;SpiderShot type training. So that's why we will use&nbsp;training_aim_csgo2_dark instead.</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>I feel like this method of training is probably the best way to improve your aim rapidly. It pretty much covers the broad scope of improving your aim at any FPS game.</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>So to test this theory I will spend half an hour a day (starting&nbsp;30 Jan 2020) for 7 days just practising the training_aim_csgo2_dark training program. Then rerun the test.</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>Here are my&nbsp;training_aim_csgo2_dark settings:</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>I pretty much always use the classic (fast aiming) mode.</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>Warm-up:</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:table --></p>\n<figure class=\"wp-block-table\">\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Mode</td>\n<td>Classic (fast Aiming)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Target Size</td>\n<td>32R</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Color</td>\n<td>Random</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Amount</td>\n<td>100</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Delay</td>\n<td>0.00</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Static tar. duration</td>\n<td>1.5 - 2.0</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</figure>\n<p><!-- /wp:table --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>Having a huge target means you can go as fast as you can without fear of missing the target and I think it's a great way to get your flick shot muscle memory.</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>Warm-up stage 2:</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:table --></p>\n<figure class=\"wp-block-table\">\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Mode</td>\n<td>Classic (fast Aiming)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Target Size</td>\n<td>32R - 12R</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Color</td>\n<td>Random</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Amount</td>\n<td>100</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Delay</td>\n<td>0.00</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Static tar. duration</td>\n<td>1.5 - 2.0</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</figure>\n<p><!-- /wp:table --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>So when I'm sort of warm I then slowly start to reduce the target size. If I see that I'm missing too many shots (10 out of 100) then ill increase the size and continue training until I'm comfortable to reduce the target size again.</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>It's the 4th of February and I can definitely see an improvement in my aim while playing games but I'm certainly no Shroud so just need to keep going.</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p></p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p></p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>Resources:</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:core-embed/youtube {\"url\":\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZfSdrCpZVU\",\"type\":\"video\",\"providerNameSlug\":\"youtube\",\"className\":\"wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"} --></p>\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZfSdrCpZVU\n</div>\n</figure>\n<p><!-- /wp:core-embed/youtube --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:core-embed/youtube {\"url\":\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vo2yeqQp1Ts\",\"type\":\"video\",\"providerNameSlug\":\"youtube\",\"className\":\"wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"} --></p>\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vo2yeqQp1Ts\n</div>\n</figure>\n<p><!-- /wp:core-embed/youtube --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:core-embed/youtube {\"url\":\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vo2yeqQp1Ts\",\"type\":\"video\",\"providerNameSlug\":\"youtube\",\"className\":\"wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"} --></p>\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vo2yeqQp1Ts\n</div>\n</figure>\n<p><!-- /wp:core-embed/youtube --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:core-embed/youtube {\"url\":\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_f_LK0-Hzdc\",\"type\":\"video\",\"providerNameSlug\":\"youtube\",\"className\":\"wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"} --></p>\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_f_LK0-Hzdc\n</div>\n</figure>\n<p><!-- /wp:core-embed/youtube --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p></p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p></p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><span class=\"has-inline-color has-vivid-red-color\">Just a reminder this article is not done yet.
