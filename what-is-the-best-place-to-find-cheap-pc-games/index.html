These sites (not mentioning names) offer a platform for people to sell their unwanted keys. The problem is that some bad actors acquire stolen credit card details on the black market and buy a large number of cd keys and resell them on these sorts of market places. The owner of these cards get the shock of their life seeing they just bought 1000 copies of Cyberpunk 2077 and get their bank to reverse the charges and the game publisher takes the monetary hit while the “reseller” still makes their money and the marketplace gets their cut. This is devastating to the developer and the end-user in the event that their key gets deactivated. That is why I recommend you avoid market places that allow other users to sell keys unless there are proper systems in place that protect against this sort of abuse.</p></div></div></section><div class="n p fy km kn ko" role="separator"> </div><div role="separator"><hr></div><section class="cw ex ey cr ez"><div class="n p"><div class="ag ah ai aj ak fa am w"><h2 data-selectable-paragraph=""> </h2><h2 id="3f96" class="ik il fc as im in io ip iq ir is it iu iv iw ix iy iz ja jb jc jd je jf jg jh dw" data-selectable-paragraph="">But wait… There are alternatives you should know about</h2><figure class="kt ku kv kw kx gw"><div class="hf s ae"><div class="ky hi s"><div class="post__iframe"><iframe loading="lazy" width="600" height="400" src="https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?src=https%3A%2F%2Ftenor.com%2Fembed%2F5140031&amp;display_name=Tenor&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Ftenor.com%2Fview%2Fyoda-there-is-another-gif-5140031&amp;image=https%3A%2F%2Fmedia.tenor.com%2Fimages%2Fca1bfc0bfd141154ebb0a61c94464df3%2Fraw&amp;key=a19fcc184b9711e1b4764040d3dc5c07&amp;type=text%2Fhtml&amp;schema=tenor" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" frameborder="0" title="Yoda There Is GIF - Yoda ThereIs Another - Discover &amp; Share GIFs" class="es ei ef hc w" scrolling="auto" data-mce-fragment="1"></iframe></div></div></div></figure><p data-selectable-paragraph=""> </p><p id="f013" data-selectable-paragraph="">Before spending any money you should investigate game subscription services that give you access to a wide variety of games for a small* fee for the month (or however long you keep the subscription). The idea here is to see how long you plan to play the particular game you want to play and if you want to play more than one game. If you want multiple games, for just one month, it may make sense to get a subscription, play your games and then cancel. Or if you want to just play one game but not pay full price you can get the subscription and cancel and have the benefit of other games if you change your mind.</p><p id="65f3" class="hm hn fc ho b hp hq hr hs ht hu hv hw hx hy hz ia ib ic id ie if ig ih ii ij cw dw" data-selectable-paragraph="">For example, I want to play watch dogs legion but I don't want to pay the full price and I only have December off to play games.

So ill rather get the Ubisoft plus subscription for one month play the heck out of watch dogs and if I have extra time I would like to play some of the assassins creed games that I've missed out on over the years.</p><p id="7ee4" class="hm hn fc ho b hp hq hr hs ht hu hv hw hx hy hz ia ib ic id ie if ig ih ii ij cw dw" data-selectable-paragraph="">Another Example, when EA finally releases a modern battlefield (I'm not a fan of the old war stuff), I will buy it at full price because I will probably spend a few hours a week playing it after work or on weekends for multiple months.
