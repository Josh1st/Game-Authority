Offensive</li><li>Destiny 2</li><li>Warface</li><li>Quake Champions</li><li>Ironsight</li><li>The Cycle</li><li>Ring Of Elysium</li></ul><p>https://youtu.be/xLLyaJy1U9Y</p><p>If you are looking for some games to play that cost absolutely nothing in the FPS shooter genre you are in luck because there are quite a few, some are very good and some not as good but still fun. I understand that everyone has different tastes so when going through this list don't pay too much attention to the games rank, just pick a game that you think is good.</p><p>Now that that is established let's see what are the Best Free Fps Shooter Games for PC.</p><h2>Counter-Strike: Global Offensive</h2><p>Counter-Strike: Global Offensive is the Quintessential FPS shooter of our modern gaming era. Its the game is very simple to understand but requires a lot of skill. If you are looking for the purest form of an fps game this is it (for our modern era).</p><h2>Destiny 2</h2><p>Destiny 2 released the base version of there game for Free, which is huge. Some people did not like Destiny 2 at launch but now that its free is really tough not to recommend. It features a relatively good multiplayer and when you get bored of that the base game is where it's at. It's a lot of fun I highly recommend this game.</p><h2>Warface</h2><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6vHOR8lzTg">LET ME SEE YOUR WARFACE!</a> Warface has been around for a while but is still very good. The game mechanics and controls feel very solid, I just wish the movement speed was faster, otherwise good TTK and seems to be quite good in the guns and mods department.</p><h2>Quake Champions</h2><p>Quake Champions is certainly a fun, intense game. It requires a fair amount of skill and has a learning curve. I haven't learned the game fully yet but I can say that I see why this game has stayed alive for so long.</p><h2>Ironsight</h2><p>Ironsight is a solid game that you are sure to enjoy, though it lacks some polish, It's still in beta so hopefully they can make the game feel more polished. however, the games polish is a pretty minor complaint and the game is worth checking out.</p><h2>The Cycle</h2><p>The Cycle is sort of a battle royal PvP PvE kind of game, I have some complaints.</p><p>1. There is something weird going on with the mouse sensitivity or something. whenever I spin up a new game I set up my mouse sensitivity so that when moving my mouse 260mm to the left the camera rotates 180 degrees and for some odd reason, when repeating a mouse movement for a given distance the camera rotates at vastly different degrees. For example, one moment I move my mouse by 260mm and the camera will rotate by 220 degrees, but then ill repeat the exact same test and my camera will rotate by 180 degrees so the current sensitivity and input implementation are not that great and could use some work.</p><p>2. The Time To Kill is a bit long to takedown players. I think it could do with 3-4 respawns but I much quicker TTK.</p><p>3. I'm nitpicking but the UI could use some improvements. The high-quality game does not match up too well with the UI, again I'm just nitpicking, it's not a big deal at all.</p><p>Other than that its a fun and unique game that breaks the mould of the traditional battle royal and I recommend checking it out every once in awhile until its full release.</p><p>UPDATE: They seem to have made adjustments to the TTK and it plays a lot better now.</p><h2>Ring Of Elysium</h2><p>Ring Of Elysium is a unique take on the battle royal genre but does not stray too far away from the likes of PUBG. I was very surprised at this games level of polish its a real contender in the battle royal scene. It probably deserves a better place on this list but like most battle royales it's very unforgiving when you die in-game and it's nice to play something that is not a battle royale every once in a while.</p></div><footer class="wrapper post__footer"><p class="post__last-updated">This article was updated on November 25, 2020</p><div class="post__share"></div><div class="post__bio bio"><div class="bio__info"><h3 class="bio__name"><a href="https://josh1st.github.io/Game-Authority/authors/joshua/" class="invert" rel="author">Joshua</a></h3></div></div></footer></article><nav class="post__nav"><div class="post__nav-inner"><div class="post__nav-prev"><svg width="1.041em" height="0.416em" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="https://josh1st.github.io/Game-Authority/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#arrow-prev"/></svg> <a href="https://josh1st.github.io/Game-Authority/upcoming-games-2/" class="invert post__nav-link" rel="prev"><span>Previous</span> Upcoming Games</a></div><div class="post__nav-next"><a href="https://josh1st.github.io/Game-Authority/best-origin-access-games-to-play-2020-2/" class="invert post__nav-link" rel="next"><span>Next</span> Best Origin Access Games To Play 2020 </a><svg width="1.041em" height="0.416em" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="https://josh1st.github.io/Game-Authority/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#arrow-next"/></svg></div></div></nav><div class="post__related related"><div class="wrapper"><h2 class="h5 related__title">You should also read:</h2><article class="related__item"><div class="feed__meta"><time datetime="2020-08-18T11:59" class="feed__date">August 18, 2020</time></div><h3 class="h1"><a href="https://josh1st.github.io/Game-Authority/best-ea-play-games-to-play-2020-2/" class="invert">Best EA Play Games To Play 2020</a></h3></article><article class="related__item"><div class="feed__meta"><time datetime="2020-02-04T18:18" class="feed__date">February 4, 2020</time></div><h3 class="h1"><a href="https://josh1st.github.io/Game-Authority/best-origin-access-games-to-play-2020-2/" class="invert">Best Origin Access Games To Play 2020</a></h3></article><article class="related__item"><div class="feed__meta"><time datetime="2020-01-28T19:10" class="feed__date">January 28, 2020</time></div><h3 class="h1"><a href="https://josh1st.github.io/Game-Authority/upcoming-games-2/" class="invert">Upcoming Games</a></h3></article></div></div><div class="banner banner--after-post"><div class="wrapper"><script>let html = document.querySelector('.post__entry');
